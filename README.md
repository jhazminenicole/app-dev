# My Favorite Series/ Movies
**1. The Last Airbender-**
This show is not just a kid show but it tackles a lot of world issues that we can relate and learned from. The show is great from start to finish and every episode shows the character development of every character. This series is about the last airbender named *Aang* and his journey to defeat the fire nation who destroyed the harmont between the four nation.     
**2. The Hunger Games: Trilogy-** It is a dystopian movie following the teenage *Kathniss* on her journey in the Hunger Games where she was force to kill other people for the entertainment of the Capitol people. This movies shows that power of the people is always stronger than the people in power.    
**3. Shrek-** This is my favorite animated movie of all time it breaks every streotype about fairytale. This is about *Shrek* and how he finds love despite his insecurities.
